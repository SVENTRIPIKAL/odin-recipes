        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients. Preheat an oven to 450 &#8457; (230 &#8451;).</li>
            <li>Place chicken breasts between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, <br>level surface. Firmly pound chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of &frac12; inch.</li>
            <li>Season chicken thoroughly with salt and pepper. Using a sifter or strainer; sprinkle flour over chicken breasts, evenly coating both sides.</li>
            <li>Beat eggs in a shallow bowl and set aside. Mix bread crumbs and &frac12; cup Parmesan cheese in a separate bowl, set aside. <br> Dip a flour-coated chicken breast in beaten eggs. Transfer breast to the bread crumb mixture, pressing crumbs into both sides. <br> Repeat for each breast. Let chicken rest for 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat &frac12; inch olive oil in a large skillet on medium-high heat until it begins to shimmer. Cook chicken in the hot oil until golden, <br>about 2 minutes per side. The chicken will finish cooking in the oven.</li>
            <li>Transfer chicken to a baking dish. Top each breast with 2 tablespoons tomato sauce. Layer each chicken breast with equal amounts <br>of mozzarella cheese, fresh basil, and provolone cheese. Sprinkle remaining Parmesan over top and drizzle each with &frac12; teaspoon olive oil.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is browned and bubbly and chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center, 15 to 20 minutes. <br>An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 &#8457; (74 &#8451;).</li>
